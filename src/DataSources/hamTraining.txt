It's all fine and dandy having the week off but when everyone else is at work I have to entertain myself for the whole day
There is no inbetween with parallel parking for me, I either do it really well or really badly

Just as I start getting comfortable being really lazy they tell us we're going to sea tomorrow
4G but no internet huh. The prices you have to pay for internet abroad are ridiculous and all you get is problems 😑

Accuweather lives up to it's name, said it was gonna rain in 2 minutes when I checked the weather and 2 mins later... it's actually raining
I don't know anyone to drink as much as them. You think you're a hard-core student? Nah. U ain't. How do they do this. I think I'm dying.
Someone remind me to never go out drinking in Germany with offshore workers again when you have work the next day.
Being on this ship for a month is gonna be nowhere near as bad as I thought. I think I might actually enjoy this

Chris Rock shouldn't boycott the Oscars. He should do what he wishes with this platform.
Dreadful news re Ashley Young. Am so so gutted. We need him right now so badly in the team. #mufc
I've completely lost the plot. Hash browns and m and m's before 11am.
Why is there a quiche called Lorraine?
"The average Londoner doesn't crack their first smile until 10am".  Surprised it's that early tbh.
On reflection, the non-retraction of a train step is quite critical to fractual spaces.
I just took some Molly what else *Future's voice*
Sarah Palin is a twat.
Either that, or he makes more films like 16 blocks. One of my fave ever.
I hope in 2 years time he realises the world is a worse off place without him and he comes out of retirement.
Ughhhhhhh what did I do to deserve waking up to such news.
Mos Def announces he is retiring. My life has ended.
WHAT
Omg WHAT
How different can -3 and -25 be really?!
So my train has been delayed because a step wouldn't retract on the train. Fuck. Actually. Off. Omfg try telling that to my boss!!

It's Boxing Day. Which means it's completely WRONG to play anymore Christmas songs. Officially hate Christmas songs again.
I love Tim Allen SO much. So so much.
Haaaweeee #homealonetwo

I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I don't exist. #ChamberofSecrets
Omfggggggg I love Justin Bieber!!!!('s) new album SO much. Ugh obsessed much! 3 weeks on REPEAT!
I need #Royalty in my life!!
Still can't believe he's dead.
I'd like to see an artist survive without the internet these days.
The album is more than 30 years bloody old. Unnnnbelievable. No such thing as Spotify bullshit back then. Pure record selling.
still selling albums and breaking records like crazy as fuck from from the grave. Only he. MJ. #THEKING
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 #THEKING https://t.co/K1WWJIC8kb
My arm is fuckered. Completely.
One. More. Day.
I wouldn't exactly call Mourinho a 'specialist in failure' for those saying he's a failure. Jesus Christ.
It's bad enough if you get given shower gel or soap for Christmas, imagine if you get given toothpaste...

It's rare that I am ever lost for words.

The greatest ever hashtag to grace twitter. #YouAintNoMuslimBruv #LondonUnited
Jimmy Floyd!
Anyway, on a brighter note, I am obsessed with Justin Biebs' album. Seriously good.
And don't even get me started on the neighbouring countries sitting on their billion pound toilets and doing F*ck. All.
How can you guarantee our 'world class' arms won't kill the innocents. You can't. You cannot.
I don't care the precision our arms have and whether they are world class advanced tech jets and concords, how is that remotely glamourous!?
In a country that has nothing, yeah let's go destroy the little that is left and possibly kill the people who haven't been harmed yet.
As a Londoner, I fear for my life.
Shit analogy, but catch my drift.
It's like you know your haters are going to gatecrash your party so you might as well reach out &amp; invite them anyway &amp; spend the extra £
I totally agree the UK is at a threat, it's obvious. And Brits have already been killed.
I wonder why none of the countries source a solution to the real problem - the banks and arms.
David Cameron doesn't even look comfortable making his own skin making this decision because deep down, he knows it's wrong.
I am disgusted. Completely and utterly disgusted.
It's not our fight. Why get involved. Can't "retaliate" on pure apprehension. Such a joke.
How can we be 'trying to stop a war' when we are trying to get the green light on bombing. Because that's not going to war...
Also you become very picky about the kind of person you'd let your guard down for
Might just stay single forever and buy a bunch of cats
Thought of being with someone is so fucking stressful now
When you're so used to being single you don't know how to let someone in &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
What are we waiting for ?
Late night when you need that love but your hotline just don't bling no more 😭

I just want to see a Bernie Sanders- Elizabeth Warren administration happen

People get all butthurt about their opinions judged on Twitter, but the fact is well informed opinions &gt; your narrow-minded take on things
A lot of people seem so appealing at first sight-until they open their mouths and share their ideas
Social media can do a very good job of stripping the joy of the moment and convincing you that your life is not good enough

My goal for the next few weeks is to learn how to swim
Tbh I've always been a @justinbieber fan from day 1.
Justin Bieber is releasing some decent stuff these days
Back day is major 🔑 
All about that solid posture because ain't nobody got time for hunchbacks.
I'm finding American football better than soccer nowadays.
What can't you buy?
Poked myself in the eye man. The pain is unreal 👁
Netball players 😍😍
I'm already looking forward to the next gym session in a couple of hours 💪🏽
I want you &amp; it's obvious.
Hopefully by the end of this year we'll have a new addition to the family.
Conversations that you'd happily skip sleep for &gt;&gt;
Sit in my whip &amp; see the stars.
I like the way you walkin' if you walkin' my way.
I hate to see her go, but I'd love to watch her leave.
We murderers, because we kill time. I knock her lights out &amp; she still shine.
She need a principle, not a substitute.
If real recognise real, who the f*ck are you?
Ciara - Body Party 🎶
When I say "I'll see" I'm basically saying "no" &amp; we ain't seeing anything. I'm just trying to be polite.
Fabolous Ft. Trey Songz &amp; Nicki Minaj - Doin' It Well 🎶
Last night was a movie &amp; it was X-Rated. Flick called Wet, it only gets better. Tonight we make the sequel and call that shit Wetter.
Written on your face, that "Yeah I'm tryna do it" grin.
Why don't you stop talking 'bout it &amp; come do it then?
Body language is the kinda talk I'm fluent in.
Lit for your love.
Wale Ft. Jeremih - The Body 🎶
A good n*gga is rare to her, truth be told, you heard it all.
Now speed it up like a Maserati &amp; look at me &amp; pose.
A little work, then it's curtains when I'm skrrtin' through.
But I know you heard my drive is crazy. Yeah, let me pace that, with some patience, let me do it till I fill every void.
Shawty can I fill your tank. I start of with that "What you drinkin'?". Pardon if I'm road raging.
Baby you got a body like a Benz. And I'm just tryna drive it once again.
Man they my homies they wanna do whatever I wanna do. I say I wanna eat they say "shit we wanna eat too".
Two n*ggaz in the front, two n*ggaz in the back. Thats 4 n*ggaz ridin' strapped in grandpa's Cadillac.
I'll Whip Your Head Boy, you know I will.
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night. She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left.
Maybe I ain't lose 'em at all. Maybe I keep movin' forward &amp; they just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all.
I got places to go, I got people to see. The penitentiary, ain't the place for me.
As far as I can see I just need privacy. I just need space to do me, get a world that they're tryna see.
Liz Ft. Tyga - Don't Say 🎶
Where the time go?
Rihanna - You Da One 🎶
Jacquees- Bet I 🎶
She looking for a man, she ain't looking for no stress.
Don't you know now is the perfect time to set the mood.
So just let down your walls, I'm a break you in.
When you're with me, ain't nobody judging we just kicking it.
I've been patient &amp; you waiting, how you want it girl?
T.I. Ft. Chris Brown - Private Show 🎶
I love how you kick it in public, but in private we on some wild shit.
Got a man, well he gon' be sour about it.
Leavin' hand prints on your derrière.
Girl take it off for me, you know just what I want. It's always hard to leave this private show.
I love it when you give me head, I hate it when you give me headaches.
Now I ain't got no kids yet, but this right here's for practice.
If she ain't good for me, she the right wrong.
She ain't mine, but she's mine for the night.

Another film to watch is Creed. Carried the Rocky legacy exceptionally well &amp; hopefully the start of a new franchise.
Would recommend The Big Short to everyone. Absolutely top class film 👌🏽
Third time at the cinema this week #TheBigShort 🎥
I wonder why the moon looks nice girl. Maybe it's just right for the night.
How's business?
Had a decent day 👌🏽
Because you don't shame something people think you do it as well 🤔
As a youngster, I never understood why Facebook had "It's complicated" as a relationship status until I grew up.
Life gets complicated man.
The call button on WhatsApp needs to be moved to somewhere else than right next to the stupid DP.
Die with me each night &amp; be born again each morning.
You can't stay mad at someone who immediately makes you smile.
To love someone is nothing. To be loved by someone is something. To love someone who loves you, now that is everything.
Always listen to your girl.
It is the unknown we fear above all.
(1) This thing all things devours: Birds, beasts, trees, flowers; Gnaws iron, bites steel; Grinds hard stones to meal; Slays kings...
Alive without breath, as cold as death; never thirsty, ever drinking, all in mail never clinking.
A box without hinges, keys or lid, yet golden treasure inside is hid.
(1) It cannot be seen, cannot be felt, cannot be heard, cannot be smelt. It lies behind stars &amp; under hills, &amp; empty holes it fills...
An eye in a blue face saw an eye in a green face. "That eye is like to this eye" said the first eye, "But in low place not in high place."
Thirty white horses on a red hill, first they champ, then they stamp, then they stand still.
Voiceless it cries, wingless flutters, toothless bites, mouth less mutters.
What has roots as nobody sees, is taller than trees, up up it goes, and yet never it grows?
Gym done &amp; dusted, now time to cook, clean the house &amp; do the laundry.
Can't wait for @djkhaled to be back home in his natural habitat &amp; reunited with his lion, flowers, jet ski, hammock, chef Dee. Liooooon!

Cheeky Nandos with the cheerleader @jessieeholliday 🍗
And that's why we always get hurt.  https://t.co/EV6QRiwcbI
Love &amp; care passionately. Just don't grow any attachment because that's when things get messed up.
I personally disagree.
So logic would say to not care about anything or anyone &amp; that way you'll be spared from any pain.
It's ironic &amp; so sad that the people you care about the most are the ones that can also hurt you the most.
My man @TaffMareya_ always combines black &amp; brown people timing 😂😂
Someone who wants the best for you, is the best for you.
Hard to move on when you always regret one.
Drake Ft. T.I. &amp; Swizz Beatz - Fancy 🎶
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together.
Better late than never, but never late is better.
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot &amp; when I find it is when I find you &amp; we can do the things we never got the time to.
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer.
Girl you got it. let em know that everything big. Nail done, hair done, everything did.
Well aren't you a breath of fresh air.
The confidence to overlook my past ways.Time heals all &amp; heels hurt to walk in but they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in.
I've always liked my women book &amp; street smart, long as they got a little class like half days.
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice. You just do it for yourself you're the f*cking coldest.
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number. You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer.
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyle, in the mall steady racking up the air miles.
You getting ready so I know we gonna be here awhile, in the bathroom flat irons &amp; nail files.
Chris Brown Ft. Bow Wow - Run It (Remix) 🎶
Got to hand it to him. I was in an exam so I had no chance haha.
So apparently is was next to impossible to get @brysontiller tickets &amp; my boy apparently managed to get four 😂
Got my @brysontiller tickets. Beyond excited!
I feel like skipping now that my exam is over!
After 11am tomorrow, I'll be free from exams until the summer 🙌🏽
Before I'd have to know every single thing for each module not knowing what would come up. But it's cool now.
My exams have been so much simpler this year. Only had to revise four topics for four essay questions.
Being strong in a weak place... that's love.
Everything needs balance.
Nature really is beautiful &amp; dangerous at the same time.
The pagh @akshaykumar wears is always on point 👳🏽👌🏽
Gonna have to get @KevinHart4real's new cross trainers 👟
Look at all the promises that I've kept.
Sweetheart is what you are.
All we ever wanted were chances.
They say time is money, but really it's not. If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got.
She likes her kisses down low.
Look at you, now look at us. All my n*ggas look rich AF.
Munda nakhro de nakhre da fan ho geya 😍😍
Wish I had good handwriting.
Dude sat next to me had the most wonderful handwriting ever. Then I looked down at my childish scribbles ☹️
That exam was actually wonderful. Two delightful essays if I say so myself. The person marking will be getting a treat 👌🏽
"They" don't want you to graduate. So what we gonna do? We gonna get a First Class degree &amp; celebrate success right! Apple, the only way!
Time to go onto snapchat &amp; listen to @djkhaled &amp; his wise words for motivation before heading into my exam.

we will not forget the #SikhGenocide. we learn more. dig. dissect. and move forth.
it was important to add diff ages. diff genders. diff angles. that room full of activists in pic 3 in part 4/4 is 75% women.
with 'rooh' we wanted to expand that. make it personal. add more subjects to the narrative that already exists before us.
the images we have today are brutal. and bloody. and are mostly of sikh men laying bleeding on the streets.
with the media blackout that took place in india there was even less reporting. less documentation. less accounts of the truth.
to understand and to archive the people.
we have some documentation of the accounts of '84. but not enough. we need more novels. more paintings. more photos. more of everything.
somewhere that got lost. somewhere something happened.
we come from such an artful history. an artful community. look at guru gobind singh ji's court at anandpur sahib. that is us. rich and lush.
we were just containers for something that needed to get out and it's out
'rooh' was such an important project for @bsinghh + i to work on. it was beyond us. it was necessary for our bones. and that's it.

our revolutionaries will be those who pushed forth with the type of radicalism that is deep love.
our revolutionaries will not be who has tweeted most.who has spoken most.or mobilized most. we are all in diff positions to do diff things.
our revolution will not be us attacking each other.  or downplaying the struggles of other communities
our revolution will be multidimensional.
so let the painters paint. let the writers write. let the organizers organize. let the singers sing. one message. through multiple weapons.
and to each their own. everyone's weapon in this fight to live will be and is different.
the most powerful thing about sikhi is the answers are already given. SGGS outlines them all. our only job is to dive in and learn
we are so privileged. if we want to nourish punjabi lives. protect sikh lives. we must think ahead and above.
our ancestors did not die on battlefields. sacrifice their bodies to torture. so that we could become keyboard warriors.
our gurus left us with a wealth of knowledge. what would they think of our strategy? our dialogue amongst each other? it saddens me deeply.
stop.
or attacking those within our own  community who have a higher social media following just cause they haven't tweeted the poster or hashtag.
we must create intelligent counter narratives. right now our counter narratives are what? an erasure and appropriation of #BlackLivesMatter?
as an online community let's be critical in our strategy. let's be intelligent. let's be honest. let's be artful.
we as sikhs are being wiped out. and have been fighting genocide for generations. our lives do matter. we know this.
semantics matter. #blacklivesmatter is not a trendy phase we can adopt and change when suitable for us.
#BlackLivesMatter isnt just a hashtag.the words hold a lineage of struggle for our black brothers and sisters. its the fight for their lives
yes. sikh lives matter. 
but not #SikhLivesMatter

I've probably lost more then you ever made in your life ! Sit down boy
I can't fuck with anyone who doesn't have the hunger to move forward and have crazy goals to achieve in life!
Strong mindset, discipline and a good strategy is life is always good 😆
You gotta have the right people in your life to make certain things happen, build a strong team and watch your empire build limitless

Good morning, may God bless you all with the motivation to chase your dreams and goals 😃 #GoGoGo
Educate yourself &amp; i am not talking about going to school college or uni !
Sometimes I wanna tweet certain things but then I'm like fuck it Twitter doesn't need to know lol

Good Morning #CantRememberLastNight 😳 http://t.co/HhHpY8t6ua
People go broke trying to impress people who don't like them
Keep it humble like wise rich men 💷
Broke people buy a Benz, rich people make money with the Benz makers
Make sure u spend some time with your family on Eid day don't be a little fuck boy in a rental no point living a ballers life for a day lol
I trust me, I need me, I won't let me down, &amp; I will be there for me ! I promise
Funny how you go thru blood sweat and tears for someone to be happy and that still ain't enough wow
Money is the solutions to everything 💷
Work hard but learn to live a little and treat yourself sometimes cos ain't nobody gonna give me sh#t
People who treat you with love and respect and shower their loyalty on you is the people you give heaven on earth to
What's with the follow and unfollow mate ? @Elijah_Oezz
Lol some girls wear so much make up its like Instagram filters walking around 😭
People see a bit of money &amp; start thinking they made it in life lol 20k is just deposit money for a house and lifetime slavery #SillyBoy
Pussy only makes a weak man break down ! Some men see some cleavage on Twitter &amp; loose theirselves 😂😂
I know multimillionaires who shop from high street &amp; stay humble &amp; I know some fuck boys who buy pair of guseppies and starve the whole week
Low key about my business major moves are always made quietly ! #Blessed
Grind while they sleep, learn while they party, live like they dream !
Got to spend some time with my pet tiger today 😄
If you wanna go fast go on your own, but if you wanna go far walk with your team, team work make the dream work 💯
We learned to provide for family rather then living off families pocket money
Woke up late this morning, no point in rushing cos I'm already late lol #GoodMorning
Nothing sexier then a woman who motivates you everyday to move forward in life and become a better man ! Its rare but it's real
The higher you elevate your woman the less available she is for other men
Good morning 😃
I wont waste my time in a "banter or pointless conversation" if we ain't talking about something meaningful, goals or money. Idc
Driving back from Scotland had a busy day, dancing like a mad man to keep myself awake lol thank god my front windows are to tinted 😂
Only people who stunt with money are the people who are new to money cos you wouldn't act like that if you knew money
If you're 25+ &amp; you don't worth at least 100k+ you slacked all your life mate don't @ me
Got some business plans that I'm gonna put into action soon &amp; get as many people involved as a can to make them some money #NetworkNetworth
Barely give my time to anyone expect family and close ones, if it doesn't bring happiness or money it's not relevant to me
Showing someone you care about them or putting someone else before your ego &amp; pride is considered lame and weak these days wow
I will always respect people who actually work hard in life and match their actions with their words👌🏽
If you smile through your worst days and still keep yourself together and keep you head up, you're the realist !
Thank you God for everything 😃 #Blessed
Too young to be stressing but too old to be childish
Money helps you live a better life, but it does not bring you inner happiness you could be a millionaire but still broke in your heart
Just checked out my hotel another busy day in London then flying to Paris this evening 😁 #GoodMorning
En route London got some business meetings over the weekend #NoDaysOff
I rather be unknown and rich then popular and broke !
Sometimes slip a couple hundred £ in your girls purse not cos she needs it just cause you're her man !
Exchange market makes a turnover of 4 trillion everyday, so if someone's making 50k a month is a small fish in my opinion !
I know some rich females who shop from high street and humble af and I know some ratchets who spend their student loans on a pair of loubs
I can't respect you as a man if you don't have morals and principles to live by
I'm gonna launch something real soon &amp; get as many people involved as a can to make them some money ! Always good to help others live well
If you raise your hands on a woman you're a straight coward !
You can keep your relationship goals I just wanna make my family rich 💯 the only love I know is family &amp; my circle
Humble and blessed 😄 thank you God for everything alhumdulliah 😃
Getting too old to post pics/vids of shit I do or shit I own, you get to the point where that lifestyle isn't new to u anymre u just live it
100% focus on yourself and your team and build your empire and watch your own lane !
I barely text/call anyone ! Don't have time for me never mind having time for anyone else #BusyLife
A wise businessman will never depend on one source of income !
You will never catch me putting my nose into anyone's business I'm far too busy living my own life and dealing with my own shit !
Been a long week gonna catch a fight to Germany for the weekend need a little break from everything 😌
Treat your mother like a queen !
If u ain't feeding your family you ain't a man !
We were making business moves while u were sat in your bed talking selfies for a bitch on snapchat !
Alhumdulliah ❤️
Lol how much money do these people make beefing with each other on Twitter lol #SadFucks
No matter how much u say to someone we will still "stay In touch" slowly u drift away from them at some point !
Set a goal that scares you but excites you the same time #GoodMorning
I only fuck with winning mentality !
Been busy for the past couple of weeks, took some time off today went for a spa did some shopping back on grind tomorrow #Blessed 😀
Alhumdlliah for everything God has gifted me with ❤️ hard work pays off 😆
Alhumdlliah 😊
Sometimes family become strangers ! 💔
Praying to God does help a lot.
Females I know that are successful are the ones who never gave a shit about relationships and men in general &amp; stayed independent &amp; focused
Some of you hate like you get paid for that shit, watch your own lane and do your own thing work harder if u see someone doing better then u
Thank god for everything you've been blessed with and stay humble #GoodNight
Females want nothing to do with a guy with no ambitions or goals in life, but can't put up with a busy mans schedule
Work hard achieve your targets make yours and your family life better and thank god for everything you have been gifted with ☺️
I Thank god for blessing me with another day every morning and pray to god every night before I sleep 😄 #GoodNight
Millionaire mindset
Happy birthday @paperstacks1 hope you have a good day &amp; make loads of money this year haha #Winning 😎☝🏽

Some of these men will go all out on a girl &amp; treat her 5 star, but won't take their mum to tesco for grocery shopping
Don't be a girl with a £1000 handbag but no £1000 inside it
If it ain't bringing me happiness or money then I got no reasons to fuck with it !
Real !  https://t.co/oYW6Dbppjk
I try to stay out of everyone's sight and focus on what i need to do ! U ain't doing shit if people see u everyday ! Don't let them see you
People don't even know what love is lol, liking someone getting their number sexing them for couple years and leaving them isn't love b kmt
I'm moving Spain mate !  https://t.co/OclREsej6r
Seen this little kid with both prosthetic legs playin with other kids with a big 😃 on his face I don't wanna hear about your little problems
Don't get why ppl are caring so much about drake and meek mills beef lol both of them are rich go make some money and make your life better
Winners don't look back !
Slowly but surely
I'm strong believer of everything happens for a reason, so If something bad does happen it simply means God planned something better for you
Alhumdulliah 😬
"Money doesn't bring happiness" make sure u make sufficient amount of money before talking that nonsense #GoodNight
Thank you @paperstacks1 for finding my size in these you're a star 👌🏽 http://t.co/cK9HSomJ52

Happy birthday bro, enough love. See you soon @ElMulino
i need you because you make me laugh more than anyone else and i'm the best me when i am with you
read, read &amp; read some more. create your own diverse opinions, educate yourself and become knowledgable towards everything relevant in life
the more i love you the more i find myself praying for you
the best thing you can do is focus on yourself and a few close others. ignore all the irrelevant people and things in your life. trust me
i just want to make my parents proud so much
having one person to discuss everything with is the best thing ever
i think i feel the most useless and empty hearted whenever i see my mother crying. it actually kills me inside
the best advice i could give to you all is make every moment you have productive. work towards your goals and search for your happiness
i'm 100% cool with having like 3 friends because people suck
how cool would it be to just meet someone who fully understands your thought processes so you never have to explain yourself
feelings are dangerous
i appreciate friends that can celebrate my successes with me rather than becoming jealous
i want to disappear and escape the stress of life for a bit
~ https://t.co/qPatSe5tDQ
and just like that we're strangers
don't you just hate it when someone reveals every single detail of the conversation you've just had with them to other people?
does loyalty even exist anymore?
it's so nice when people show their appreciation for you once in a while. it's good to know your worth with certain people
i've experienced both a physical connection and a mental connection with people and honestly, mental connections are so much more beautiful
why feel guilty for cutting people off who don't serve you purpose? only give energy where your growth is celebrated &amp; dreams are honoured
it's a little sad how so much of your time is spent studying, go to work etc that you feel like so much of your life is being used up
#GrowingUpBritish when this store existed https://t.co/5WSDA4UjXD

• https://t.co/HMYre4gPzN
really can't wait until i have my own house and can just chill all day with the person i love without being worried about anything
somewhere between try harder and why bother
work on yourself, focus on you &amp; you will see how your life changes. i've gained so much inner peace from learning. i only need to please me
i don't think i can go longer than 10 minutes of studying without getting distracted by something
do you ever just open a book and stare at it for about 30 minutes without anything sinking in? because that's me. all the time
deep thoughts ft. lack of sleep
girls will overthink but guys just don't think lol
arrogance makes a person ugly
"i pray for you" means the same thing as "i love you"
insha'Allah this year everything will fall into place. I really hope so

find yourself someone poetic and ghost
you know when it's too hard to sleep because you have so many thoughts in your head and you're just sad with life?
everyone wants to be the expert of your life, as if they know what you have been through &amp; somehow deserve the right to tell you how to live
i get aired 281% of the time
i think if you've found the right person already, you actually can't wait until you're married  https://t.co/bTDiihXvMu
i want to travel
put your ego aside and tell them openly how much they mean to you
if you really love someone, time and distance will not make you forget them
does anyone else sleep with bae over the phone sometimes?
let's just skip to the point in life where i have completed my education, i've married, had kids and am all settled down
you ever reach that point where you actually crave a particular person's presence? like just them being there is enough to make you content
it will always be the most comforting feeling to just have someone there. always. no matter when and where, they're just there for you
do you ever feel like you crave someone's presence, as if they're your drug?
in a room full of art, i would still only stare at you
have you ever come across someone that the more you get to know them the more you just fall in love with them?
hate it when you need to talk about something that bothers you but you feel like you've already talked about it too much so you back off
you can meet somebody tomorrow who has better intentions for you than someone you've known forever. time means nothing to me, character does

don’t lose your faith. you can be cool and stay centered. don’t compromise your beliefs to fit somewhere you won’t even stay long
just because i find you physically attractive doesn't mean i like you. you're appealing to my eyes, not my heart or mind. chill
today i overheard a kid say "i don't believe in that but i respect that you do" then i i realised how a kid is more mature than half of us
my greatest achievement? being able to call you mine
what's rare is to find someone who's happiness means more to you than your own because you realise yours is dependant on theirs

If my potential doesn't fear Allah then I wouldn't want her because why would I spend my life with you if you're not reaching for Jannah?
Anybody that wouldn't drop someone for you isn't worth your time.

I don't deserve any less than what I'm willing to offer in a marriage.
